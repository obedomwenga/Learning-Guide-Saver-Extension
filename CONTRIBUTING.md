# Contributing to Learning Guide Saver

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/your/project/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your/project/issues/new); it's that easy!
